# Machine-Learning-for-the-Design-of-Low-Stacking-Fault-Energy-High-Entropy-Alloys
#The evaluation of the five mainstream machine learning models was conducted to accurately predict the stacking fault energy of CoCrFeNiMn-based high-entropy alloys. Specifically, this includes the Multilayer Perceptron Regressor (MLPR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), Random Forest Regression (RF), and XGBoost regression algorithm (XGB).
